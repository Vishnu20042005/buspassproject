# Bus-Pass-system

## System Features

1. Description and Priority
The bus pass system keeps track of buses, seats, prices, and reservations. It also keeps
track of bus passes for trips inside a certain city. Of course, this initiative is a high priority
because travelling across cities in buses without previous bookings is quite difficult. It
simplifies the procedure of purchasing city bus tickets while also lowering the financial
load.
